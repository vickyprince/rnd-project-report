        This study explores the development of robotic manipulation skills within a simulated environment, focusing on the task of stacking two differently colored cubes. By leveraging the ManiSkill2 framework, we integrate reinforcement learning and supervised learning approaches to teach a robotic arm the precision and adaptability required for stacking tasks. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of simulation-based training, highlighting its potential for broader applications in robotic manipulation. The successful application of these learning methods provides insights into the challenges of robotic object manipulation and offers a foundation for future research in enhancing robotic interaction with physical objects.
